### Empowering Mobility Through Open, Accessible Design

At **GoBabyGo**, we believe every child deserves the freedom to move, explore, and experience independence. The **Core Build Kit** is our open-source effort to share the core components and lessons from years of building customized electric cars for children with disabilities.

This kit reflects over a decade of iterative learning, hands-on problem-solving, and feedback from hundreds of families and builders. Our mission is to make adaptive ride-on vehicles simpler, more consistent, and easier for other GoBabyGo chapters, makers, and caregivers to replicate and customize.

> 💡 The kit is built for collaboration. Whether you're improving it for your local chapter or adapting it to new use cases, we welcome your ideas and contributions.

### What's Inside the Kit?

#### 🔘 **Push Button Adaptation**

We replace foot pedals with accessible hand- or head-activated push buttons. The kit includes:

* A no-solder generic **pedal-to-jack adapter**
* Modular **push button mounts** for off-the-shelf (e.g., Logitech Adaptive Kit) and custom buttons
* Stable, flexible **mounting connectors** for various control schemes
* Mods and Extentions models for different use cases.

#### 🪑 **Seating Customization**

Standard seat belts rarely meet the needs of children with disabilities. Our approach:

* Wide, adjustable belts with printed mounts and tri-glide adjusters
* Low-profile mounts for use with adaptive bike seats and close-fitting car frames

#### 🧩 **Modular PVC Mounts**

* Headrests
* Lap boards
* External support structures

> Currently supporting 20mm PVC parts for building lightweight but sturdy.

### 🧠 Stabilized Adaptive Push Button (v1 – Prototype)

A robust, customizable switch (65mm) designed for adaptive electric cars, toys, and gaming environments. It offers enhanced stability, tactile feedback, and compatibility with common low-profile mechanical keyboard switches.

#### Key Features:

* **X/Y Stabilization** — Reduces wobble, improves actuation consistency
* **Swappable Springs** — Adjustable actuation force for different users
* **Snap-In Mounting** — Supports common low-profile switches (Gateron, Kailh)
* **Child-Friendly** — Durable with engaging tactile response
* **Logitech Gaming Kit Compatible** — Includes mounts for Logitech large buttons
* **JellyBean-Style Cap** — Transforms switch into a classic accessible form

### Materials and Printing Recommendations

All printed parts are designed with accessibility and ease-of-use in mind. We recommend:

* **PETG** filament for safety and durability
* 0.35 mm layer height for most parts, 0.2 mm for fine details.
* Mounts designed for M3 screws or zip-tie options

### Why This Kit?

Crafted by the Israeli chapter of GoBabyGo —  Over the course of building \~800 adapted vehicles, we realized the value of **consistency**, **modularity**, and **collaboration**. The Core Build Kit simplifies complex adaptations without sacrificing the flexibility needed for each unique child. Our long-term vision is to see this kit evolve as a community tool—shared, improved, and loved by chapters and makers worldwide.
